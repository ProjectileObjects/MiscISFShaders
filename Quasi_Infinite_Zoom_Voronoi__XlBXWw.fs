	Quasi Infinite Zoom Voronoi
	---------------------------

	The infinite zoom effect has been keeping me amused for years.

	This one is based on something I wrote some time ago, but was inspired by Fabrice Neyret's 
	"Infinite Fall" shader. I've aired on the side of caution and called it "quasi infinite," 
	just in case it doesn't adhere to his strict infinite zoom standards. :)

	Seriously though, I put together a couple of overly optimized versions a couple of days ago,
	just for fun, and Fabrice's comments were pretty helpful. I also liked the way he did the 
	layer rotation in his "Infinite Fall" version, so I'm using that. The rest is stock standard 
	infinite zoom stuff that has been around for years.

	Most people like to use noise for this effect, so I figured I'd do something different
	and use Voronoi. I've also bump mapped it, added specular highlights, etc. It was 
	tempting to add a heap of other things, but I wanted to keep the example relatively simple.

	By the way, most of the code is basic bump mapping and lighting. The infinite zoom code 
	takes up just a small portion.
